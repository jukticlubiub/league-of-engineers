        1. <strong>Who Can Play</strong>: Only students from SETS can
        participate. You can&apos;t use your club or group names or logos on your

        2. <strong>Tournament Format</strong>: The tournament will have
        different stages: Group matches, Quarters, Semis, and Finals. We can

      </p>
      3. <strong>Team Composition</strong>: Each team must have 8 players and at
      least one IUB Faculty Member as a manager or player. The Faculty Member
      can be from any department. Only current students can play. Graduates will
      have their own team.
      <p>

        essential. No bad behavior or misconduct will be tolerated.
      </p>
      <p>
        17. <strong>Punctuality</strong>: If a team arrives five minutes late,
        it&apos;s a 3-0 win for the other team. Match times will be strictly

      <p>
        18. <strong>No Sliding Tackles</strong>: Sliding tackles are not
